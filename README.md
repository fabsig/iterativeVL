# Iterative Methods for Vecchia-Laplace Approximations
This repository contains the R code for the simulations in the paper "Iterative Methods for Vecchia-Laplace Approximations for Latent Gaussian Process Models".

The iterative methods for Vecchia-Laplace approximations are implemented in the package GPBoost: https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost.
